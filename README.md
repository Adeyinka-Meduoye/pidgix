Pidgix is a Nigerian-Pidgin–focused AI language agent that translates, rewrites, and converses in authentic Naija Pidgin with cultural accuracy and natural flow.

It isn’t just a word-for-word translator — it understands tone, slang, context, and regional flavor (Lagos, Warri, Abuja, street vs. respectful speech). Whether the input is formal English, casual chat, or business language, Pidgix converts it into Pidgin that sounds human, relatable, and locally correct.
